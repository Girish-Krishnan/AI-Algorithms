# Lab 4: Bandits, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and an Introduction to Q-Learning (5 points)

**Deadline**: Monday, May 6, 2024 at 11:59pm on Gradescope

This assignment has 2 parts.

## Installations

This assignment involves two Jupyter notebooks `Bandits.ipynb` and `MDP.ipynb`. There is also one Python script, `slot_machine.py`. You can use Google Colab or DataHub or a local Jupyter notebook to run the notebooks. To run the Python script, however, you will need to have Python installed on your system because the script uses a Pygame GUI window that is not supported in Jupyter notebooks.

Before running the script, ensure you have the following modules installed on your system:

* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Pandas
* Pygame
* Argparse
* Gymnasium (OpenAI Gym)

You can install these modules using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn pandas pygame argparse gymnasium
```

## Part 1: Bandits (2.5 points)

All the instructions for this part are in the `Bandits.ipynb` notebook. Remember that you will work with both `Bandits.ipynb` and `slot_machine.py` for this part. 

## Part 2: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Q-Learning (2.5 points)

All the instructions for this part are in the `MDP.ipynb` notebook.

## Submission

Make sure you've completed all the `TODO` sections in the notebooks and the Python script. When you're done, submit the following files to Gradescope:

1. `Bandits.ipynb`
2. `MDP.ipynb`
3. `slot_machine.py`
4. `mdp.gif`
5. `mdp_q_learning.gif`

Make sure to save your files before submitting them. You can submit as many times as you like before the deadline. Only the last submission will be graded.

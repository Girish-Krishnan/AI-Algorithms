    "# COGS 188 Lab 5 Part 2: DNA Sequence Alignment with MDPs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the lab, you will implement a DNA sequence alignment algorithm using Dynamic Programming by modelling the alignment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). DNA sequence alignment is a fundamental problem in bioinformatics, where the goal is to find the best matching between two DNA sequences by inserting gaps or mismatches as needed. Some applications of DNA sequence alignment include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparing genetic sequences to identify similarities and differences.\n",
    "- Identifying evolutionary relationships between species.\n",
    "- Predicting the function of genes and proteins, based on known sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### DNA Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA sequences are composed of four nucleotide bases: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). Sequences can vary in length and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DNA Alignment Problem Details\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "The optimal alignment maximizes a score based on:\n",
    "- **Match score:** Positive score for matching bases.\n",
    "- **Mismatch score:** Negative score for non-matching bases.\n",
    "- **Gap penalty:** Negative score for inserting gaps in the alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact values of these scores can vary depending on the specific alignment algorithm and the biological context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**States:**\n",
    "- Each state is a tuple representing the position in the two sequences $(i, j)$:\n",
    "  - $i$: Index in the first DNA sequence.\n",
    "  - $j$: Index in the second DNA sequence.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Example Sequences\n",
    "```python\n",
    "example_seq1 = \"ACGGTCA\"\n",
    "example_seq2 = \"ACGA\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alignment Matrix:**\n",
    "- The alignment matrix (or scoring matrix) is a grid used to store the scores for aligning subsequences.\n",
    "- It has dimensions $(\\text{length}(\\text{seq1}) + 1, \\text{length}(\\text{seq2}) + 1)$, where:\n",
    "  - The rows represent indices of the first sequence, `seq1`.\n",
    "  - The columns represent indices of the second sequence, `seq2`.\n",
    "- The value at position $(i, j)$ represents the score for aligning the first $i$ bases of `seq1` with the first $j$ bases of `seq2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Alignment Matrix:\n",
    "Given the sequences:\n",
    "- `seq1`: `\"ACGGTCA\"`\n",
    "- `seq2`: `\"ACGA\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial alignment matrix would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "|  | - | A | C | G | G | T | C | A |\n",
    "|--|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **-** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| **A** | 0 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n",
    "| **C** | 0 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n",
    "| **G** | 0 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n",
    "| **A** | 0 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actions:**\n",
    "- Actions represent the movement in the alignment matrix:\n",
    "  1. **Diagonal:** Move diagonally, indicating a match or mismatch between bases.\n",
    "  2. **Horizontal:** Move horizontally, indicating a gap in the first sequence.\n",
    "  3. **Vertical:** Move vertically, indicating a gap in the second sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rewards:**\n",
    "- The agent receives:\n",
    "  - **Match:** Positive score if the bases match.\n",
    "  - **Mismatch:** Negative score if the bases do not match.\n",
    "  - **Gap penalty:** Negative score for inserting gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**\n",
    "- The goal is to find the optimal alignment that maximizes the alignment score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will involving completing the `DNAAlignmentMDP` class. This class will contain methods for initializing the MDP, performing value iteration, and tracing back the optimal alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the implementation, you will need to complete the `TODO` sections in the code provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Structure:\n",
    "- `__init__`: Initialize the MDP with sequences and scoring parameters.\n",
    "- `dynamic_programming`: Implement the dynamic programming solution.\n",
    "- `initialize_value_function`: Initialize the value function.\n",
    "- `fill_value_function`: Fill the value function using dynamic programming.\n",
    "- `update_value_function`: Update the value function for a given position.\n",
    "- `traceback`: Trace back through the value function to produce the aligned sequences."

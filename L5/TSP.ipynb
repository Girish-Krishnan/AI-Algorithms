    "# COGS 188 Lab 5 Part 3: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "In a previous lab, you learned how to solve the TSP by modeling it as a constrain-satisfaction problem (CSP). This time, you'll tackle it using dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a set of cities and the cost to travel between each pair of cities. The goal is to find the shortest path that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. In this case, the \"cost\" of traveling between cities is the Euclidean distance between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Space:**\n",
    "   - A state $s$ is represented as a tuple:\n",
    "     - $s = (c, V)$\n",
    "     - $c$: Current city.\n",
    "     - $V$: Set of visited cities represented as a bitmask.\n",
    "   - Example state: $(2, 0\\text{b}1011)$, where:\n",
    "     - $2$ is the index of the current city.\n",
    "     - $0\\text{b}1011$ represents the cities visited so far, which means that cities $0$, $1$, and $3$ have been visited and city $2$ has not been visited yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Action Space:**\n",
    "   - An action $a$ is the index of the next city to visit.\n",
    "   - Possible actions from a state $s$ are all cities not yet visited in $V$.\n",
    "   - $a \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} \\setminus V$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transition Function:**\n",
    "   - The transition function $T$ defines the next state given a state-action pair:\n",
    "   $$T(s, a) = (a, V \\cup \\{a\\})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "   - $s = (c, V)$ is the current state.\n",
    "   - $a$ is the next city to visit.\n",
    "   - $V \\cup \\{a\\}$ is the updated set of visited cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reward Function:**\n",
    "   - The reward function $R$ defines the immediate cost of traveling from the current city to the next city:\n",
    "   $$R(s, a) = -d(c, a)$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where $d(c, a)$ is the distance between cities $c$ and $a$, where $c$ is the current city.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Goal:**\n",
    "   - The goal is to find the optimal policy $\\pi^*$ that minimizes the total travel cost:\n",
    "  \n",
    "   $$\\pi^* = \\arg\\min_{\\pi} \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{T} R(s_t, a_t) \\right]$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "   (For simplicity, we'll set the discount factor $\\gamma = 1$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "   - $s_t$: State at time step $t$.\n",
    "   - $a_t$: Action at time step $t$.\n",
    "   - $T$ is the planning horizon, which is the total number of cities in the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Value Function:**\n",
    "   - The value function $V$ represents the minimum travel cost from a state $s$:\n",
    "   $$V(s) = \\min_{a} \\left[ R(s, a) + V(T(s, a)) \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Q-Matrix:**\n",
    "   - The Q-matrix represents the expected cost for each state-action pair:\n",
    "   $$Q(s, a) = R(s, a) + V(T(s, a))$$"
